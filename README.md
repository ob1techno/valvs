# Vālvs
A cascading quad tube VCA module in Eurorack format, using NOS Soviet 1Ж24Б tubes.

Vālvs provides four gnarly tube VCAs with adjustable, switchable distortion, feedback, drive and gain controls.

Vālvs’ outputs are daisy-chained, allowing adjacent groups of 2, 3, or all 4 channels to be mixed together.

Based on/inspired by the work of [Ken Stone](https://www.elby-designs.com/webtek/cgs/cgs65/cgs65_vca.html), [L-1](http://l-1.su/TubeVCA.html) and [Émilie Gillet](https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/veils/).

_N.B. this is currently in development and not verified as working_
